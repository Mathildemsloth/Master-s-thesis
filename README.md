# Spousal bereavement and cause-specific mortality among Danish older adults
### Investigating spousal bereavement with a Dual Approach: Causal Inference and Predictive Modelling Methods.

This project is my master thesis in Public Health Science from the Univerisity of Copenhagen.

The code for the project is diveded into three files: 
- Data preprocessing
- Analysis: the average bereavement effect on cause-specific mortality
- Analysis: predicting cause-specific mortality

The data for the analysis is individual level data from Statistics Denmark. The data can only be shared under specific conditions. According to Danish law, scientific organizations can be authorized to work with data within Statistics Denmark and can provide access to individual scientists inside and outside of Denmark. Data are available via the Research Service Department at Statistics Denmark: www.dst.dk/da/TilSalg/Forskningsservice for researchers who meet the criteria for access to confidential data.
